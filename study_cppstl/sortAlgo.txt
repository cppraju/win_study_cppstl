quick sort

function quicksort(array)
   if length(array) <= 1
      return array
   select and remove a pivot value 'pivot' from 'array'
   create empty lists 'less' and 'greater'
   for each 'x' in 'array'
      if 'x' <= 'pivot' then append 'x' to 'less'
      else append 'x' to 'greater'
   return concatenate(quicksort(less), list(pivot), quicksort(greater))

This pseudocode represents the basic concept of QuickSort. It first checks if the array 
length is less than or equal to 1, in which case it just returns the array. If not, it selects 
a pivot value and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, one with elements less than or equal to 
the pivot and one with elements greater than the pivot. It then recursively applies the QuickSort 
function to these two sub-arrays and concatenates the results to get the sorted array. Please note 
that this is a simplified version and actual implementations may vary. For example, the choice of pivot 
selection can greatly affect the algorithm’s performance. Common strategies include choosing the 
first element, the last element, the median, etc. as the pivot.
